The location is remote and beautiful, here you will see Galicias beauty on full display.

It was an honor to know him and a privilege to help him.The animals are a reflection of their guardian. I've never seen this many animals so a peace before, they are all kind natured and curious and it's a pleasure to see them thrive in this environment.Finally, the work. The work I did is some of the most rewarding I've ever done; from helping to feed and water the animals, cleaning their spaces, making them new field and accommodations. The results are instant and it was incredible to see the difference made from the mere 3 and a half weeks I spent there.I would like to thank Christopher and all the animals for the time I spent there and I hope I will get to see them all again.",

The cats stay outside (unless weak ones but they have their own room).The house offered what we need. The cosy kitchen was the only heated (fireplace) room, so we spent most time there.-Living-We loved staying with more volunteers. The first week we were with 7 and ate almost every lunch and dinner (vegan!) together, most times also with Chris.Since we brought a car, we could do some nice visitings in the area, or visit Chantada (15 min drive) for a Coffee or beer. The place of the sanctuary is isolated (nice!) but therefore it was good to sometimes leave the place for ex the afternoon.NoteOne thing we think is important to know: working with animals means that all the tasks need to be done everyday.

This can be sometimes very hard, so ask yourself if that is what you want.We really loved this, because we put the animal needs above ours, like to do physical work and are used to very wet and cold weather since we are Dutch.We learned so much in this place!

Chris came 1-2 times a day to give us some clues on the work to be done, he also brought us food when he did so. As we both really like donkeys and have been on the road for some months now we truly appreciated to work there.

During this time I was able to meet wonderful people (teachers, students, other WA volunteers), learn so much about Moroccan culture and Muslim principles, explore many parts of Morocco from the trips organised by Harim, and experience local small town life.Taks was minimal and depended on the day (from Wednesday evening to Sunday morning, 2-4 hours). No preparation was needed for the class, just bring enthusiasm and energy! The level of conversation will differ depending on the class and there is also a large range of age brackets you will come across (children, teenagers, college students, working adults...). But after this, volunteers would be absolutely free to work/study/travel. If you have any questions or suggestions, do not be afraid to ask Harim or the school staff, they are all very kind and willing to help in anyway they can. Apart from the work, it was great to bond with so many other WA volunteers who enjoy travelling the way we do, not a 1-2 day meeting/farewell and all seek a unique experience in a foreign country.My Morocco travel was amazing as it was through this WA and I look forward to coming back to this beautiful community/family.",

                    "W_Review_P": "Hi Harim and all the beautiful team that made my time in Morocco so special!I am sorry for the late review, but since it's long overdue I will get right to the point. At first I only planned to stay for a month but found myself staying with Harim for 6 weeks working in the schools in Downtown Casablanca and El Jadida. I was by far not the only… read morevolunteer staying for longer than intended, which I think is very telling. Everyone makes sure that you feel welcome and comfortable from day one.The teaching is very easy and fun, it allowed me to learn a lot about the lives of the students and their view on the world. It would usually consist of short conversations with one to three students of all ages and levels. The working hours were very reasonable and Harim tried the best he could to accommodate for our wishes in order for us to have some time to work (online) or explore the City. As long as you keep an open mind the teaching is nothing to be nervous about. Among both the teachers and students I had beautiful and memorable interactions, which I am very grateful for.I stayed in the apartments associated with the two schools I've been to and found them to be very social environments where I made many friends among the other volunteers. Be prepared to have somewhat limited privacy, though. While living in a relatively tight space with persons from wildly different backgrounds and beliefs can be stressful sometimes, it will definitely improve your communication skills and broaden your mind. I really enjoyed the sense of community we had among ourselves.Several times each month there are trips to the desert or the coast or the north of Morocco. I went on the desert trip together with 20 or so other volunteers from all the schools, which meant that I got to know lots of cool and interesting people from the other schools. For all of us it was a highlight, we got to see Marrakesh (briefly), the Dades canyon and the desert near Merzouga and did some cool things like sand boarding down the dunes. Another time I joined up with two of my co-volunteers to rent a car and do a little road trip down the (gorgeous) southern coast between the teaching days. (Note: We organized that on our own but it's cool we could agree to get enough time to do so - circumstances allowed it but it may not always be the case)In my opinion Casablanca was the more interesting of the two cities I volunteered in. It was great to mingle with the locals in one of the bustling markets, do some sports/read a book in a park or go on an evening walk to Hassan II Mosque. Having a little everyday life in another city was one of the great perks of this volunteering experience. It is also great to keep your expenses way down (especially if you shop groceries in the medina and not the supermarket).The biggest challenge by far was communication, as there was always something to request, like improvements or repairs in the apartments and it turns out that juggling ~30 volunteers between 4 different locations is not an easy task. Personally I had no real issues though, I tried to always make my intentions clear and stick to the hours expected from us.My favourite part was the social component of the whole experience, as I met people from literally every continent of the world (save the Antarctic), among them many lovely locals who were more than happy to share their knowledge with me.A big thank you to everyone who was a part of this, I will always carry my time in Morocco in my heart!",

There are 4 schools, Casablanca uptown, Casablanca Downtown, El Jadida, Berrchid. I stayed 2 weeks in uptown Casablanca, 2 weeks in downtown Casablanca and 1 week in… read moreEl Jadida. The downtown Casablanca apartment was separate from the school and is based in the centre of Casablanca, a short walk to the medina, the uptown Casablanca apartment is within the school building but has its own floor and it is a little bit further from the centre. The El Jadida apartment was also located within the same building as the school just down the hall, however this was my favourite. The apartment was very nice, with a huge rooftop terrace that is only accessible to the volunteers, and in the two out of the three rooms given, you had your own balcony. The city was much calmer than Casablanca, and the beaches here were also very nice. I was lucky enough to meet a talented musician here and was able to listen to him play with other talented musicians in the local area most nights, and it was incredible, seeing all the locals coming together and creating music was so nice. I wish i had more time here.I got the chance to live with very lovely people from all over the world. You get 3/4 days off (in El Jadida it is a little different, i am pretty sure you only have Monday off) and during this time you can go and see different parts of morocco or go on these amazing trips that Harim organises for all the volunteers. I 100% recommend going on these trips, it is a chance to meet all the other volunteers from the 4 different schools, and also explore the cities for a good price. There is the desert trip and the Chefchouen trip. During these trips I met some of the most amazing people and shared beautiful experiences with them. I was surrounded by people speaking French, Spanish and German, and i think i have picked up a lot of vocabulary from them ,especially the french ;) The driver, Jawad is also one of the nicest people you will meet, he took care of us on these trips. He was so funny and nice.The work/teaching was very easy and simple, the teachers give you a topic and you have simple conversations with the students. In downtown Casablanca and El Jadida, classes were only 1 hour a day, more or less apart from Saturday which i think is a little longer, they are also scheduled at a good time, normally around 19h/20h so you have more than enough free time to explore the city. The teachers and students were also very nice, and it made me happy seeing the students super eager to learn.I want to thank Harim for everything that he organises and for being so nice and helpful. Also allowing me to have experiences and make memories that i will never forget. Hilal (Harims assistant) was also super nice, he always asked how you were and made sure you were ok. Thank you Harim for letting me stay here, it was amazing. I wish them the best and I hope to be back soon :)",

Both are incredible. They happen every two weeks or so and alternate. Both are absolutely incredible. They're much, much cheaper than any other tour offered in the area.- There are four schools, called \"uptown\", \"downtown\", \"Berrechid\", and \"El Jadida\". As far as I can tell, volunteers' placement upon arrival is based on availability, but the possibility for transfer is possible. In \"uptown\" Casablanca, you are located about 20 minutes by car from Hassan II Mosque and the rest of downtown. You stay in a building on the floor above the school. It's very big and there are many rooms available. In \"downtown\" Casablanca, you are closer to the mosque & medina. You stay in an apartment that is a five minute walk from the school. The apartment is cozy, but there is still plenty of room. Volunteers from uptown and downtown often spend time together and travel between apartments. Downtown's schedule is a bit more intense than the other schedules, but it is considered the \"best\" place to stay. \"El Jadida\" feels like an apartment as well, though it is located above the school. The El Jadida residence is about a ten minute walk from the ocean. I did not go to Berrechid. It's on a farm.- The schedules fluctuate fairly often and you should be ready to adapt based on the changes. Even then, it is a flexible place, and you will still have room for many trips. I took overnight trips to Casablanca, El Jadida, Marrakech, Rabat, and Tangier while still attending all the classes.I cannot express how grateful I am for this Workaway.

                    "W_Review_P": "Living in Harim's community for 3 weeks was the best thing that could have happend to me in Marocco.First things first, let's talk about our host, Harim. Originally, I was supposed to staye at another workaway, but it was cancelled just 2 days before my flight to Marocco. Luckily, I found this last-minute opportunity as a teacher at a language… read moreschool, therefore I immediately reached out. It didn't take even 10 minutes before I recieved a response from Harim that I can stay. He was really brief and to the point, so I didn't really had to ask what to do. I just had to pack my things and I head to Marocco. Every weekend, Harim prepared for us some trip around Marocco (I personnaly did the desert trip and Al Jadida trip), which were one of the greatest moments. Even though I sometimes didn't get what exactly was the trip about, Harim always managed to work everything out and organize the trip perfectly. For me it is a real mystery how he could manage everything - it is not easy to take care of 4 school and another 20 volunteers. In conclusion Harim is really hard-working, outgoing and kind person (albeit a bit confusing at times😄).Another thing is the \"working\" part. I put there quotation marks because tasks (teaching) you are given are quite easy and sometimes it can get a lot interesting when you are teaching English to more advanced students. This allows you to start conversations about their culture, politics, life etc. In the morning, you primarily teach children, which can be from time to time exhausting. However, do not worry it's still simple. :)Harim runs 4 schools and I had the honor of staying in three of them (Berrechid <3, Al Jadida, Casablanca). The accomodation is mostly appartments, where 5-7 people can comfortably fit with plenty of space. The appartments are clean and cozy. In Berrechid flat where I stayed the most, we received Marrocan national dishes for a lunch every working day. Because the appartmentss are in the city, there is always something to do in the evening or during your free time between the lessons such as drinking tea with locals, going to the gym or playing pool.Overall, I believe my three-week trip couldn't have been better. For not that long period of time, I absorbed the local atmosphere and culture more than I could ever imagine. If you are seeking for some remarkable experience that you hope you would never forget this workaway is for YOU!Thanks - Stepan",

Depending on if you are an English or French speaker, as well as the distribution of other volunteers at the time, will determine which location you are at.This WorkAway was one of the best experiences of my life.First of… read moreall, Harim is an extremely nice man who always does his best to make sure his volunteers are comfortable and have what they need. The work is quite relaxed, laid back, and fairly minimal (note that the schedule does change depending on when you visit). The teachers and employees of the school are extremely welcoming and friendly, particularly Salma and Sarah. The students are very nice and most are enthusiastic to talk to WorkAwayer's and practice their English.I had the opportunity to live and become friends with many other WorkAwayer's, some of whom are now friends for life. You will never be lonely on this WorkAway. Harim organises trips to many famous Moroccan cities. He kindly allows his WorkAwayer's to stay at his apartments in Chefchaouen and El Jadida free of charge.My only criticisms would be that the communication from the school / teachers can be quite poor. There were several occasions where there was confusion over our working schedule, breaks, finish time etc. We were sometimes given very short notice to come in earlier and often asked to stay late, which, if you have plans, can be problematic. We tried to be flexible, but this was an ongoing issue for the duration of my stay.The apartment in Downtown is also in pretty poor condition - mainly the bathrooms. There is a lot of mold and damp and the showers, although they work, are somewhat broken. The shower door is broken which results in the bathroom flooding every time someone has a shower, for example. The apartment also lacks some basic amenities such as a microwave, an oven, mirrors, bed sheets, pillows etc.Nevertheless, I truly had a fantastic time and I cannot thank Harim enough for having me. I was meant to stay for 1-month, but ended up staying for a little more than 2-months as did many other WorkAwayer's during my stay. I think that's a very positive reflection on this WorkAway.Thank you, Harim. Hopefully I will see you again soon!",

If you enjoy traveling with a group, monthly trips to Chefchaouen and the desert in Merzouga are also offered to volunteers that are interested! Prices vary depending on the city, but I found it all to be extremely affordable.Harim, the head of the program, is a remarkable human being. He is a generous individual that works hard to ensure everyone's safety and satisfaction - including the teachers, volunteers, and students. Harim’s dedication to his craft is unmatched. His uninhibited enthusiasm for language education is infectious. He was a joy to communicate with throughout my stay, as he is a top notch problem solver and negotiator. Special shoutout to Sarah, the head receptionist of the downtown Casablanca school. She, as well as the other teachers, are an absolute delight. Sarah is a great resource for anyone interested in learning Moroccan Arabic (Darija) during their stay.The volunteering itself is simple and fun. You are not the teacher, just a communication partner for Moroccans looking to improve their English. The age and level of each student varies. One day I was discussing the currency exchange rate with a trilingual eight-year-old, and the next I was listening to a mother of three tell me about the members of her family. The longer you stay, the more time you have to connect with each student on a personal level. Soak it all in!I’m extremely grateful to Harim, my incredible housemates, Sarah, and the downtown Casablanca students for making my first visit to Morocco a wonderful one. Not only did I feel safe, but I felt beyond welcomed to Morocco. It was a month well spent of diving into the language and culture of the country, while enjoying the benefits of Morocco’s world famous hospitality. Inshallah I will see you all again soon.

For that, the volunteers role is helpful to encourage students to speak with foreigners, use the language vocabulary and skills that they learned in the previous lessons with their teachers and have the opportunity to get in touch with different cultures. As volunteer you will speak with different students about different subjects, so if you don’t have experience as teacher, don’t worry, it’s an easy task and the teachers will be always around to support you. You will learn a lot about Moroccan culture just talking with the students, they love to share everything with you! 😊Besides, Mister Harim and the rest of the team will make sure that you enjoy your stay in Morocco and will help you to organize all the trips that you can imagine to visit the country with others volunteers. No one was bored there! I preferred to stay in Casablanca because I wanted to know better the city and spend more time with the people that I met there, so that’s possible too.To finish, I just want to say that I totally recommend to volunteer with this schools. I learned some things from the teachers, it was nice to meet the different travelers that were there at the same time and I really loved to share this weeks with the students and the staff working there.Love to all of you, specially Khalil and Fatima, the two greatest persons that I met from the Casablanca team 😊 And see you again after corona!",

Getting to know other volunteers coming from all over the world added to the experience as well. Harim, here is a message from Sam (15 years old): \"Thanks Harim for everything. Honestly at first I didn't wanna b in Morocco. But your academy taught me a lot and I am forever thankful for this. Thank you so much let's meet up again someday!\" The highlight of our trip was the camel trip in the desert. The 5 weeks we were there were perfect for me.

He also provided us with cous cous every Friday and even took us to watch a Moroccan football match one evening! The work is easy and I really enjoyed speaking with students of varying levels of English. The only downside is the lack of communication at times (I spent over two hours waiting at the train station when I first arrived with no contact from the school). Those hoping to work by distance should also know that there is no wifi in the central Casablanca apartment (only limited wifi at the school), so it’s best to buy your own data or go to a cafe across the street.For females travelling solo and especially my fellow blonde sisters, even if you’re covered up you will still get a lot of attention in Morocco. BUT, the locals are incredibly lovely people who are genuinely just curious. If you respond nicely and say ‘no thank you’ when men ask for your WhatsApp and Facebook (happened to me daily) they will generally leave you alone. If you respond aggressively (which I also saw girls do), you will understandably get an aggressive response in return. The online blogs about solo female travel in Morocco are a bit harsh in my opinion as I always felt safe here, even when I was alone 🙂Overall, I highly recommend this Workaway and I would love to come and stay again in future.",

I couldn't rate it highly enough. Thanks again, Mr. Harim for all that you did for us. Your effort and generosity do not go unnoticed. Until next time.-Campbell",

Also, the area we were staying at wasn't that safe but we weren't told, we found out ourselves in the worst ways (I was followed once). The other 8 volunteers and myself would've appreciated some instructions or a brief explanation of where we were but that didn't happen. The profile makes it seem like you work 4 days and travel 3 - that is pretty much your decision. The trips are paid by yourself, not the school or Harim so take that into consideration. The Arabic classes are given one hour a week. There is no internet in the apartment, we were able to connect to the wifi when we were at school only.On the bright side, we met really cool people here (workawayers and students). The work consisted in just having conversations about different topics everyday with the students. We really liked going to school and helping them, it's a simple but very humbling experience. Our schedule was from 3 - 8 pm and we had a 1 hour or 1 h 30 min break at around 5 pm every day. We saw Harim once.We and other workawayers were supposed to stay for a month, but we ended up staying for two weeks due us being part of terrifying events. Harim's response was disappointing and we decided to leave. I hope Harim can work on all of these for future volunteers. I would recommend women to be very careful if they decide to go to Casablanca's school.",

When I got in contact with Mr. Harim, he immediately responded and welcomed me to stay at his school for whenever I feel like; one month later I was in Morocco and was informed to join the school in Berrechid. In contrast to other volunteers, I didn't really have or make a choice which… read moreschool I want to attend, but I am more than happy to have ended up in Berrechid. The place itself is not worth a visit, but the school, the teachers, the students and most of all the other volunteers were great! Within only a few days it felt like family and a home abroad. Another reason why I liked my stay in Berrechid was because the school was a whole building with one floor only for the volunteers, two floors with classrooms and a rooftop to hang out. A kitchen, several bathrooms (only one shower, but manageable), washing machine and enough space for enjoying and spending time on your own are provided too.The schedules for classes normally start around 7pm and end at 9.30pm, fridays and sundays are off and on saturday there are only afternoon classes. The conversations with the students were a lot of fun and interesting for learning a lot about Moroccan traditions, food, recipes, weddings and world views as well as the student's own dreams and plans. I enjoyed the different levels of the classes and amongst all of them the kids classes seemed to be the most challenging ones. I also admired the teacher's energies, the vibes they spread and with how much love, passion and openness they taught English. Some of the students just started to learn English four months ago, but we had almost fluent conversations. Anyway, I really enjoyed and loved my stay there!I am fascinated by Mr. Harim's enthusiasm to bring the volunteers closer to the locals and the Moroccan culture as well as his ideas to expand the school network, build up other projects and help people in need. He offered us to take the school's car for weekend trips several times, organised trips to the desert and also took a small group of our school on a spontaneous trip to a sheep farm on the country side. After I left the school in Fes Hr. Harim even helped me to stay at a local's place in Chefchaouen which was cheaper than any hostel.A bigbig thank you and all the best! Shukran",

Her dishes were incredible.Elisa and I decided to take this workway experience because Harim (the manager) was offering Arabic lessons appart from the accomodation and the Cuscus on Fridays. That is why after these two weeks, we decided to change the place to Casablanca, since in Casablanca the volunteers were taking the Arabic lessons. I have no words to describe this experience. I feel so close now to the Moroccan culture, not only because of the conversation with the students, but also thanks to my friendship with the teachers (especially Sara and Omaima) and also the recepcionist Houda.The students are amazing, they are so willing to talk and to know about your culture, and to show you everything about the Moroccan lifestyle. The teacher usually gives you one topic to talk about that day but the only important thing is to make them feel confortable speaking in English. Any topic is welcome, 0 censorship and I loved that.In Casablanca, the load of work is not too heavy. We used to have all the mornings free (except Saturdays) and in the afternoon, we used to work up to 4-5 hours In Fez we only worked around two or three hours from Monday to Friday and some Saturdays.The accomodation in Casablanca was perfect. It is a big appartment where you usually share the room with 2 or 3 people and it is located near to the medina and 3 minutes far from the school. The living room was beautiful, it is painted by 2 volunteer who used to stay there in the past. The only problem is that sometimes it is dirty (although a girl cleans it every Friday) and that it doesnt have wifi, only inside the school.Harim is very friendly and flexible with the days off. If you need a whole weekend free, just let him know and he will manage for covering you.The Arabic classes were great, One of the English teachers (Sara) was our Arabic teacher also, and she is super lovely and special and incredible as a teacher.For last but not least, I just want to thank Harim and especially to all the staff and volunteers who made my stay amazing. and of course to all the students who made me cry the day that I left because I will keem them all in my heart for ever,Hope to see you all soon!",

The job itself is very interesting, you exchange everyday with students (children and adults) about different subjects and can both learn a lot about each other culture and way of thinking. I also advice you to feel free to propose some new things to Harim and the teachers if you have some artistic talents or just motivation and the students will be happy to learn french or english in a different way.

I realise lots of people enjoyed their time here however there are some things I wish I had known as I would probably have made a choice to go somewhere else which would have suited me better. Unfortunately I ended up staying only 3 days. This was due to firstly a change of venue. I had agreed to go to the Casablanca school… read morebut on arrival was told there were some problems with the appartment and I would be taken to another. Actually I was taken to stay the night in the family house. While I appreciated the kind attempts to make me comfortable this wasn't what I had been expecting and hadn't been warned in advance so I found it a bit confusing and stressful. The next day I was told I would go to the school in Berrechid instead where the appartment was better. So I went there. Berrechid is a small town where people are not used to tourists. This is certainly an interesting experience if you are looking for that however I found that for the same reason it was a difficult place to be and that was not what I was looking for as a solo female traveller on my first visit to Morocco. We were advised by a poster on the wall not to go out after dark or even in the day time to the busy places and I found that it was the case that it was not safe or comfortable for me to do so alone. I decided to leave because 1. There is nothing to do in Berrechid, 2. I didn't feel at all comfortable or safe going out on my own there 3. The apartment was far too dirty for me (I am a very clean and tidy person and 36 years old and it was very much a student-like shared living situation) 4. It was cold in the house ( I was there in January) the rooms are in the basement and no heaters. 5 There wasn't anywhere to lock valuables - I had asked about this and was told there was but actually there wasn't and I had brought work stuff like my laptop and camera with me.On the up side: The teaching is very easy (actually I would have preffered to have been doing more), Mr Harim does go out of his way to try to keep everyone happy and to be hospitable. It is on the train line so Marrakesh and Casablanca and further and trips further afield are possible. You can take time off to go on trips for a few days at a time.I know a lot of people enjoyed their time there, others were also unhappy about things like cleanliness of the house and not being comfortable going out (women) but stayed on anyway.I'm not saying this workaway isn't good just that it wasn't a good fit for me personally and I think that Mr Harim's desire to please everybody meant that he wasn't as clear about things as he could have been with me. This resulted in my coming to a place that just didn't suit what I was looking for. A bit more info and transparency would be welcome and I don't think it would cause in any way a lack of volunteers but would avoid anyone else like me turning up and then feeling the need to change their plans on finding things are not as they expected.",

For some westerners, the accommodations may seem rough, but by Moroccan standards they are actually above standard - NOTE: Always carry toilet paper in your pocket wherever you go in Morocco and bring your own towel for use in the apartment.There is a lot of idle time during the day, which is difficult for some people - if you require constant movement and stimulation, you may have difficulty. If you enjoy solitude and time for reflection, this place is perfect. This is an Islamic country so you will not find bars and pubs here, there is no party nightlife so for those who seek that - keep seeking.  The school has wify so you can catch up on your correspondence. There is ample time to read, you will need to bring books with you as this is a new project and there are many things, such as a library exchange, still in development. The accommodations are still in development and are made better with the contributions of each workawayer that  passes thru. Being part of an evolving program was an honor and a privilege and I hope the few things I am sending over for the apartment will make the stay of the next volunteer just a little more comfortable as this is a very worthwhile program and I encourage others to be a part of it.Thank you Harim for your outstanding hospitality! I look forward to returning next year!",

                    "W_Review_P": "I am writing this as I wait for my bus to Tanger, in a comfortable room, a luxury that was haggled by Mr. Harim himself! He took time out of his busy schedule (he cut his dinner party short!!!) to drive me and three other girls I'm traveling with to the bus station and bargained with the driver to give us a good price, along with a nice room for… read moreus to wait 2 hours in. Me and the girls are currently discussing how Mr. Harim is collectively the most humble, proactive, generous, and genuine person that we have ever met! You might think that's a pretty catastrophic statement, but this is seriously true, I highly recommend you come see for yourself! He is so concerned for our safety, and wants us to see as much of Morocco as possible, FOR THE CHEAPEST cost! I came to him for any advice I ever needed during my time here. He was always there to show me the best way to get to the places I wanted to go, which included: Chefchaouen (blue city, a MUST to see while you're in Morocco!!!), Fez, Atlas Mountains, Sahara Desert (AMAZING once in a lifetime experience), Tangier (favorite city in Morocco), and many beautiful little pit stops along the way! With the most genuine smile, Mr. Harim was seriously was the most incredible workaway host ever!Now that we've covered the fact that Mr. Harim is just an angel, on to the volunteer experience! The school downtown school in Casablanca is close to the apartment, and we volunteer anywhere from one to five hours per day! The students are eager to learn and talk to us \"guest speakers\" as they call us, and it's very fun to talk to locals about their country and their daily lives! The teachers are also very nice and welcoming! The work is not hard at all, we basically come and sit in a room to wait for the teachers to come walk us to their classroom, so we can converse with the students for around 15-30 minutes at a time. We are required to come to the school from 11-2 pm and then 5-6:30 pm. Depending on the day. So even when we are volunteering at the school, we have a lot of spare time (and wifi!! The apartment does not have wifi in Casablanca, but Fez does!) to get things done!You do have to be adaptable for this workaway which was a positive for me, but just something to keep in mind! Some people who need a set schedule might be thrown off at first because things happen really out on the whim here! One moment we will be sitting in the school, the next we will be running to the apartment to pack for a trip the next day!All in all, my three weeks spent here were 10/10! I recommend you bring your own toilet paper, paper towel, towels, bed sheets, mosquito repellent, mirror (there are no mirrors at the apartment!) I can't believe my 3-week adventure in Morocco has come to an end! Morocco has become my favorite country in the world!",

                    "W_Review_P": "Though long overdue, I want to add my feedback to the loads already here. It should be clear from all of the other comments that Mr. Harim is a genuinely warm person and that you will have ample opportunity to enjoy your time at the workaway. Interacting with students, teachers, locals, and other workawayers is supremely rewarding.That said,… read moremore details may be useful to help properly shape expectations for those considering this potentially wonderful opportunity to experience Morocco. Mr. Harim cares tremendously that you enjoy your time in Morocco, so he is very generous with both time and information to help facilitate side trips. And though the work is generally light, your commitment when you sign up is to be available as a guest speaker most evenings of the week. This means that you should be prepared to coordinate your travels around the needs of the school, perhaps traveling in rotation with other workawayers to ensure adequate guest speakers are available when necessary.You may be better served to respect and observe local culture and expectations to a reasonable degree, especially when interacting with students. Wearing shorts, short-sleeves, pants if you're a woman, etc. may draw unwanted attention. Learning a few key phrases and numbers in Arabic and/or French will also serve you well. This is especially true in less touristic cities such as Berrechid. BTW, a taxi ride from the train station to the school in Berrechid should only cost you 7.5 or 10 dh, depending on the time of day. Casablanca is a large city, so you can expect the usual modernities that are associated with a metropolis, including slightly more leniency in dress, etc. Parts of Fes are quite touristic, but the surrounding hills and narrow streets of the medina make it feel a bit less hectic than Casablanca.The accommodations are also remarkably basic in Berrechid and Casablanca, though I hear that the situation may be different in Fes. My suggestion is that you come with the readiness of potentially improving the accommodations yourself; since work is relatively light, there is plenty of time to be handy and creative. Mr. Harim is always willing to provide funds to support workawayer needs. In the hostel-like accommodations, so you may end up in a mixed dorm situation with folks of all ages, genders and nationalities. Getting to interact with and travel with fellow workawayers is one of the highlights of the experience, really, but try to reduce drama by having an open mind and consideration for one another.In short, if you come with the right attitude and mindset, there's no doubt that you will enjoy your time as a workawayer in Morocco. It is a lovely country of diverse landscapes with a people and culture just as beautiful. Shukraan to Mr. Harim, the school staff, the students, and the other workawayers for a wonderful first workaway experience!",

In turn, I was able to provide an example of what my culture is like once we get beyond the news headlines. This type of sharing and cooperation is the antidote to the negative, uninformed discourse which exists today.Mr. Harim is an exceptional man. He continues to expand his school project as a way for Moroccans to improve themselves and create a better future for them and their families. He also ensures that the volunteers are able to see the true Morocco by taking them on trips that are not in the tourist brochures. Whether it be a trip to the Atlas Mountains for 2 am couscous or a camel expedition in the desert, these are unforgettable experiences that he enjoys sharing with his volunteers.I doubt many volunteers leave the place without considering Mr. Harim a new friend. I highly recommend a stay at one of his schools.",

If you want to work all day long this project is not the best for you.I had lot of work to do, hence this workaway suited me because I had enough free time to get it done. Plus, Casablanca is perfect if you are a runner! I used to run every other day with a friend and we loved running along the seashore!Harim is a special person. He is ready to welcome you and to help you out with everything you need. His main goal is to make volunteers happy. Although he was very busy, when he had some free time he took us somewhere cool. With him we had amazing meals, visited the bidonville and the lighthouse! he took us to the souk and got us the best avocado juice I have ever had! He helped us to plan trips around the country and he shared with us tales and histories. He was open to discussions and willing to explain every aspect of the Moroccan culture.I am very thankful i met you, Harim, I really appreciated what you did. If i could give you an advice I would say to start delegating and to better organize the volunteers' days. I am sure that volunteers are a rich resource and you can give us something more \"important\" to do. we are willing to take responsibilities and, I think, you can trust us. After all, we are here to help :)To conclude, Morocco is a challenge,but absolutely worth it!",

The desert… read moretrip, which Mr. Harim facilitates for you, was the highlight of my trip and super affordable. You wouldn't find a better deal elsewhere (I know because I tried). During your days in either Berrechid and Casablanca, however, you may find yourself bored. Having a personal project or being someone who likes chilling out and doing nothing will help! If you don't know where you'd like to work, maybe this will help;Berrechid- Pros:-You get to stay in an apartment a few blocks from the school, giving you more freedom and privacy-Berrechid is suuuuper cheap. I literally almost spent nothing there.Cons:-There is very, very little to do here. Even Moroccans think Berrechid is boring.-Absolutely no tourists come to Berrechid, so your presence is somewhat disturbing to some. I had some children throw stones at me on one occasionCasablanca- Pros:-Bigger city = more to do and see-More free time-Probably safer because there are more people aroundCons:-More expensive-You sleep in the school so you have less provacy, there's also no really communal area to hang out besides the kitchen-As a woman, the sexual harassment in Casablanca was exponentially worse.Cons aside, I'm glad I got to experience both. I met some great people: fellow workawayers, employees of the school, Moroccan students, and especially Mr. Harim himself. Everyone was very welcoming and helpful, and getting to speak with Moroccans every day about their culture was a real eye-opener and asset that I wouldn't have gotten without this opportunity.Thanks Mr. Harim.",

Looking back I think it was good, because volunteering at the school was an amazing experience that truly blew my mind. The reason I liked it so much is because for me travelling is all about people you meet, not just the places… read moreyou visit.So to start with our host Harim, who is exceptionally hospitable person, very generous and good-hearted. He made us feel at home and was always willing to help in every possible way. I can write a lot more but I'm sure enough is being said so far.Well and the work itself was something that I really enjoyed. Talking to students on various topics was one of the most enriching experiences in my life. The work is not much and there are many opportunities to engage students even more. With some of the volunteers there we started movie nights, informal conversations on topics chosen by students. We even did something like job fair and presentation for available business opportunities and free online education. The possibilities are numerous, and the best thing is that students really appreciate this kind of activities. So if you are person with ideas and you want to help students to improve their English you can make a difference for sure. The only drawback for me was that some of the volunteers didn't seem to care  much about \"the work\" at the school and in the classes they tended to speak too much about themselves leaving not room for students to practice their speaking skills. But of course this is something not to blame the school for! Again thanks to Harim and all the students that gave me the opportunity to see the country beneath the tourist surface :)",

Michel also really enjoyed talking with the student's and learning about their lifestyles which are so wildly different than ours at home in Canada and Belgium.We volunteered for 10 minutes some days and over an hour other days (getting lost in conversation with the students). It just depends. The teachers knocked on our door when they needed us, and on the white board there were class times written down so you know when to stick around. Friday couscous was great and fun to share with the other volunteers and you get Sunday's off!!You have plenty of spare time to visit the city and the teachers and other volunteers are super helpful with things to do and places to go. Just note that Casablanca is not like Marrakech or Essaouira... it is not a tourist city and there is not much to do, but you can create your own fun with the other volunteers and even have time to pursue a hobby.The living quarters are in the school, just opposite the hallways and in 3 rooms there are bunk beds and in 1 there are mattresses on the floor. There were lots of people when we arrived so we were in the mattress on the floor room, which turned out to be box springs on the floor. It wasn't the most comfortable bed (it was really hard) but we lasted two weeks on it without any real problems!The kitchen (very basic) has a stove top and a sink for cooking your own meals (although there are soooo many great places to eat out) which was really nice. The kitchen tended to get messy with so many people living there. The sink kept clogging but you just unclog it and go on your way! The shower and bathrooms were clean and well kept but you'll need to bring/buy toilet paper.One issue was keys. There were 2 sets of keys when we arrived (for all 8 volunteers) and then by the end 1 set. They were in the middle of changing the locks so things got a bit confusing. Definitely get the phone number or email of another guest or one of the teachers that live there so if you get locked out you can let someone know. They should have it all figured out soon.Harim was a kind and welcoming host. He was always there to help when we asked for it and he also showed us the best restaurant in town!!!! Be sure to ask him before you leave it is delicious!He's very easy to talk to and he hosts volunteers like they're family!

One of the teachers was even willing to teach Arabic for us, being the volunteers/the guestspeakers. Sometimes there was a demo-lesson and teachers gave each other feedback, which is perfect. In Berrechid the accommodation is fine, there is a lot of space, there is a cleaning lady etc. etc. However: The surroundings are a bit boring.In Casablanca the accommodation is lesser big, lesser good (cleaning lady wanted!), but the surroundings are very lively. You really live in the center of the city and that can be very convenient of course! By the way: The Moroccan couscous was always there at both locations every Friday!In general: What we liked most is the philosophy of working as guestspeakers. We - the international volunteers - were the guestspeakers. At the end of each lesson we talked with the students about very interesting topics, chosen by the teachers (compliments!) Guestspeakers and students are really learning from each other! For us it was not that necessary to travel a lot, because the students were the best guides! They always told us about their Moroccan culture! Because we enjoyed our talks with the students so much, for us it was a little bit a pity that the lessons were mostly only in the evening hours. That means that there are a lot of 'empty' hours during the day. Perhaps an idea to give volunteers more tasks depending on their skills. For this reason it will be clear that we liked the Saturday most, because that was a busy school day. It is great that the language institute has the intention to realize for example an English café on Sunday: Talking English in an informal setting should be fantastic!To end: We can really recommend this place: An environment where everybody is very kind and helpfull. We want to thank all the people (staff, teachers, office ladies, students, volunteers) for the very special period we spent in Morocco. Mister Harim, thank you so much for everything and keep up the good spirit!!!Warm greetings,Ben and Desirée (from Holland)",

In the few days I was here, he took us for a tour through Casa, showed us the huge moskee next to the sea, took us for shoarma, couscous and fresh fish, and drove us to El Jadidad for a visit to this cute Portuguese town.It's true that the work don't ask a lot of your time, so a lot of people come here to have a calme period, to write or work, and to use the place as a base from where they can do trips to other cities, to the mountains or to the dessert. I'm not sure if it's always possible like that, but from the stories that I hear I think it is, so as long as you communicate it well you can take roles to leave for a few days while others stay to participate in the classes.Those classes are actually fun: it's really just talking to the students, and in the short time you're having a conversation with them you can get to know a lot about Moroccan culture, just by asking everything you want to know to the locals :)If you can handle with the big city, I'd totally recommand this place from where you can visit whole Morocco, with a host that will do everything to make you feel comfortable in his country!",

It was really a chance to learn more about Moroccan culture from the… read moremore fluent students, and for the students to ask questions of us too.Generally the conversation practice in the evenings started around the same time and could be very short, up to maybe a half hour, when we were there. On Saturdays there are classes throughout the day, so volunteers should plan on not going too far that day. Harim was flexible when we told him in advance of our plans to travel and return to the school. Ask him to show you the best couscous/tajine restaurant in town!Because the work is light, the group of volunteers at any particular time can have an impact on the experience. And like others say, it's a good place to have some of your own work to do. :)Casablanca itself, as everyone says, is not a touristic city, and not the most exciting place, but it offers a look at everyday modern urban life in Morocco, away from souvenir stands and restaurant touts. It lacks green space, though there are a couple parks you could walk to. One especially (Murdoch?) is lush and pleasant. There are not so many \"sights\" but we found some things interesting to see. The medina is not exactly scenic compared to others but it is a great chance to buy good produce and unforgettably tasty sweets...Thanks, Harim, for our stay, and good luck with your plans to expand!",

After Harim gave me a mini-tour of Casablanca,  I decided to volunteer in the relative peace and quiet of Berrechid rather than in the busy city of Casa.  (Both the Berrechid and Casablanca schools are wonderful, so it just depends on which lifestyle you prefer and where space is available.)A week after my arrival, I found myself on a 3-day whirlwind bus trip organized by Harim for the benefit of around 40 students, staff and volunteers from both schools.  The adventure included riding a camel to a desert campsite where we spent the night eating delicious homestyle food outdoors, listening to traditional music, and sleeping in bivouac tents with people I had just met.  This instant \"total immersion\" in Moroccan culture set the tone for the rest of my stay at the academy, and I am ever thankful for this and the many other opportunities provided by the school during my stay.It was being immersed in the culture and exchanging opinions with the students, teachers, staff and other Workawayers that was indeed my greatest benefit.  Although I had been an ESL teacher for 41 years in New York, I learned a lot from Harim and especially the incredible English and French teachers in the school.  The system of open dialogue with the students, teachers and volunteers in every class was much more than language practice, as the cross-cultural exchanges also made us reflect on our own values and perceptions of other countries.I will never forget the generosity of spirit, open-mindedness, wonderful sense of humor and genuine kindness of the teachers, of Kawtar, the compassionate manager, of Zineb, the bright and welcoming receptionist, and of Fatina, who tirelessly kept the school clean.  I thank Harim for his vision and dedication to his schools, and for giving me this opportunity to explore Morocco in a safe and caring environment.I came to Morocco to help teach, but it was I who learned the most.",

                    "W_Review_P": "I stayed at Harim's Language School in Berrerchid for most of the month of November.  I would like to thank Harim for his hospitality as well as Kawter, Fatima, Anna, Ramadan and the other teachers for their friendship and support during my stay.Harim has two schools, one is Casablanca and one in nearby Berrerchid.  Both schools are close to… read morethe airport and to other forms of transport making it easy to get around.  Mostly the students are the schools are adults and young adults who want to learn/improve their English/French for their job prospects or for their current jobs.  Classes are mostly held at night between 6 - 9pm and all day Saturday (currently there is also a class on Sunday in Casablanca).In terms of effort required this workaway requires little.  Each evening (and all day Sat) you sit in one of the classrooms whilst lessons take place.  Towards the end of the different lessons you might be called upon to talk with the students.  The students often had a \"script\" that they went go through with you, according to what they had learnt in class that day (or previously).  At times these could be more like interviews and felt quite one sided and sometimes intrusive (How old are you?  Is anyone in your family rich?). Sometimes they didn’t make sense (what do you look like?  Is your sister/brother ugly?).  Other times it felt like conversation, both parties talked, laughed and it felt like both the volunteer and the student would gain from the interaction.  It was often quite funny when you talked with a group and they would pull out their notebooks and recite everything you had told them the lesson(s) before.Interaction with the local townspeople and also the school’s students outside of class is frowned upon and basically forbidden by Harim.   However Harim will happily organise excursions and day trips for you if you wish to learn more about local towns, the desert, or if you want to go to the locals souks.  When he is not teaching it is his goal to make the guests happy.   Harim can be very flexible on you taking a few days off here and there to allow for travel and exploration.I spent my time with the Language School at the Berrerchid site.  There are two rooms here where workaways can stay and there is also a 3 bedroom, one bathroom apartment close by where up to 7-8 people live.   Living conditions at both places are basic, however very liveable.  I would liken it to camping indoors (with a mattress).  I would recommend taking a sleeping bag and pillowcase with you as there is no guarantee of clean bedding upon your arrival.  If you live at the school there is an amazing cleaner who comes 3 times a week and keeps all communal areas sparkling.  She also makes couscous and chicken on Fridays.   All other food (and other goods such as toilet paper, washing powder, bottle water, coffee/tea, etc.) you can easily purchase at any of the shops nearby.Neither Berrerchid nor Casablanca are going to win any awards for their excitement level.  Berrerchid especially.  This can be hard when you have your days free.  Take your kindle, a pack of cards or your laptop with you.  I work remotely a few hours each day and that kept me busy (when the internet worked well).If travelling on your own (as 98% of us were when I was there) it is also important to know that there are not many westerners in Berrerchid.  Try to go out in groups/pairs when possible.  I had stones twice thrown at me by children, as did a number of the other workaways whilst I was there.   Whilst out jogging I was stared at, just walking to the shops I would receive marriage (or other….) proposals as well.  Be ready to be thick skinned.  However bear in mind these things (not the stone throwing though) I also experienced in other towns in Morocco.   Also, for every negative there is also generally a positive.  Whilst at the markets I had several people help me as well as some great service in nearby shops and restaurants.  The staff at the bakery near the school are lovely as are the owners at the nearby Italian café, we had some great service at the local Hamman too.   Of course there are also the great teachers and staff at the school who are always there to help and befriend you.",

This is the key thing to understand, because a lot of people come expecting to teach and are disappointed when they realize that’s not the case.  I really enjoyed my conversations with the students because not only was I helping them with the language but I got to learn a lot about Moroccan culture this way.  Often our conversations would carry on after class was over because the students were so engaged and wanted to learn more about the volunteers.  This made it especially nice for me.There isn't much to do in Berrechid, so you’ll have a lot of free time since the classes are in the evenings.  This allows you to plan day trips to Rabat or Casablanca and still be back in time for classes.  For me personally, this wasn't a problem, but some people like to keep busy.  If you’re one of those people I would suggest that you bring some books to read, sneakers if you’re a runner, or whatever you do to occupy your time.  You also have plenty of time on the weekends to plan trips to cities further out.  Harim is very flexible and has no problem with you taking time off for longer trips during the week.  He is also very knowledgeable and helps you plan for any trips.In terms of food, everything in Morocco is super cheap, so buying groceries is not a problem.  This is especially nice since fruits and vegetables are fresh and readily available.   If you’re like me and don’t cook very often, buying street food is also extremely affordable.I’m really glad I had the opportunity to volunteer at the Academy. I met some wonderful people during my stay, including teachers, students and other volunteers. Overall I had a positive experience and would definitely stay there again.",

Because of the… read moretime of year (end of July-early September) there were less classes than usual, which meant there were times when volunteers had little work to do, which was actually a shame since helping out in the classes were always the highlight of my day!The classes always proved to be interesting, and I often learnt English language rules that I never knew existed! The students were very friendly and eager to learn and talk to the volunteers. Helping out in the classes never felt like work.When planning our trips Harim was always helpful, whether he organised the whole trip for us (the desert trip) or simply picked up bus tickets from the station for us.Some of my trip highlights:-The night I spent sleeping in the desert camp-The day I spent at the bridge of God at Akshour-Forming friendships with volunteers and students in the classes.-The several occasions when the students or Harim brought in lunch for the volunteers (Moroccan food is simply delicious)Before doing this workaway there are a few things to be aware of:-The accommodation is basic (be prepared for a few cold showers and maybe bring your own pillowcase)-While most Moroccans are incredibly friendly and genuinely kind, be aware that girls get a lot of stares and comments from men, even when covered up and simply going to the supermarket.-Berrechid, the town where I stayed, does not have that much to do and many locals do not speak English or even French, however there is usually some way of communicating.-Always be careful with your belongings.Overall though, I would encourage people to do this workaway, I'm sure anyone that does will have a great experience, full of exciting trips, meeting amazing people and eating lots of great food.",

Most people washed their clothes in the sink.You will be buying everything for yourself- from toilet paper, to cleaning supplies, and of course food. Do not expect clean bedding upon your arrival.There is not a set schedule- things start late and the schedule is always subject to change. Socialization with locals is discouraged if not prohibited.This experience is what you make of it! Harim is there to help you, but keep in mind he is a busy man. I enjoyed getting to know the other workawayers and learning about Moroccan culture by traveling in my ample spare time. This workaway project is in the beginning phases, and I do not doubt that it has the potential to be fantastic.You will not be teaching English, at the end of a class you will be used to have short conversations with students to practice their English.The living conditions are considered uncomfortable by many Western standards.",

Although the industrial city of Berrechid isn’t necessarily a holiday destination, I enjoyed spending time there, buying produce from the local shops, drinking coffee at Cafe Dream and being invited for couscous with local families. Harim also assisted me in arranging trips to other cities including Tangier, Casablanca, Tetouan, Chefchaouen, Mohammedia, El Jadida, Bouznika, Rabat and Fes. In Fes Harim arranged for some other volunteers and I to stay with a friend of his who even had a driver pick us up at the train station (we were all impressed).Most of all I enjoyed talking with the Moroccan students, learning about Islam and Moroccan culture and helping them practice their English. Many interesting conversations were had in class. I learned quite a bit during my stay and feel enriched by the experience.It may be helpful for volunteers to recognize that Moroccan culture is different than that of the west and some cultural confusion around expectations and communication may occur. From my experience the culture is very welcoming and warm and I was treated as a guest of honor by the majority of Moroccans who I met. On the other hand, because I was considered a guest and the Moroccan style seems at times to be less direct than I am familiar with in the west, there were times when I was unclear of exactly what was expected of me and how I could help most based on my skills. This was especially true when I first arrived. The pieces all fell into place though and things made more sense as I spent more great time there.I am very thankful to Harim and happy that I have made a new family in Morocco.",

Also, flexibility is required a lot of times but that was just perfect - I certainly never felt bored :) Even though Berrechid itself doesn't offer a lot of things to do, I enjoyed living there for a while immensely - just as well as all the trips to different places we went on. In only six weeks I saw quite a bit of Morocco, from the Sahara desert to the main cities to more remote areas with outstanding landscapes. Harim is great, very welcoming and helped us tremendously with organizing our trips. He genuinely wants you to make the most out of your Morocco experience and see as much as possible of the country. The teachers are amazing as well and I just can't thank Harim enough for the possibilites he provides for workawayers.Yes, there have been things that I didn't enjoy as much or that I didn't agree with but they're nothing compared to the good things I got out of this experience!Thank you so much Harim, and I really hope to come back in the future!",

I really appreciated every moment Harim spent making the time in Morocco for me and the other volunteers as enjoyable and memorable as possible, like the bus ride to the Atlas Mountains and Marrakesh, the Friday… read morecouscous for lunch, which we eat like a tribe on one giant plate, and the vegetable and meat tagine he brought for us every Saturday, and his advice on going to Chefchaouen, a picturesque town to where we hitch-hiked where most buildings are baby-blue, and also the tour he gave me of the city of Casablanca (it's a mad, chaotic place! You have been warned!). Harim has been instumental in helping me to get a great deal out of my stay in Morocco, and I consider him a bellweather of kindness and goodwill. Also, when I got into trouble with the Gendarmes (police in white coats who I call the road doctors) for hitchhiking for a taxi on the main road at night, he came to get me and the other guy I was travelling with late at night at the police station, when he could have been with his family. For that I am grateful, that he took valuable time to save us, these young, irratic nitwits! If not for Harim, I think the Moroccan police would have tortured us... Both with sweet-talk and by making us eat more and more and more until we could not do it anymore! That gives you the idea of true Moroccan hospitality!Teaching as a job has been very pleasant here in the academy, as the students warmly embraced us and were keen to learn our colourful and important language that is English! Many of the students, especially the young ones, are quite adequate in the language, and require helping to speak. The Academy emphasizes speaking most of all, so it helps if you know how to chit-chat and entertain. I was aweful at chit-chat, but I know how to entertain, so I felt happy with my job there! The discussions we had about our cultures were very INTERESTING. Yes, you will find out when you go there! The staff were very accomodating as well, and brought great quality and leadership to their lessons.Also, beware that if you come here, you are coming to a Sharia country, which means things are quite different here. Harim really cares about the image of the school, and he will say himself that Moroccans judge a book by its cover, therefore the actions of the fellow teachers reflect upon him and the school. Therefore, the best attitude when you come is curiousity with a reserved and cautious attitude. Harim will tell you everything you need to know. Oh, and dont buy anything without asking him, that is one of the most important rules!God bless you Harim! I will visit if I come to Morocco again!Mattias",

All of this is variable and you, as a volunteer, DO NOT perform ALL these tasks, so it ends up being a peaceful day to day because everyone helps each other.Food and accommodation: Really good, I loved the experience of vegetarian (and also vegan) food during the period!!Communication: I am as passionate about humans as I am about animals, perhaps this is the only sticking point in my experience. Unnecessary stress, lack of organization (which resulted in inefficient cleaning of the house, since everything was literally dirty instantly), no active listening and little value for the work done. The time to sit down at the table is a very important moment for me, it's when we exchange with each other, and that in fact wasn't something relevant there, eating is a mere exercise of necessity. Also, language was mainly German but I think it is completely understandable - we are in their country and home, not the opposite...Dirt: As mentioned in previous feedbacks, there were rats and flies (in large numbers) circulating in the kitchen - however, it is something that can be solved from the moment someone wants to solve it...In summary, the project deserves a lot of value! If you have the opportunity to go, go without a doubt, I do not regret it at all. There are sheep, horses, donkeys, goats, dogs and others that NEED support and constant work - what Anke does for them is magical and I am so grateful that she has opened her own home for me and for so many others (if I'm not mistaken, Anke already received around 100 or 200 volunteers...

The nature and animals are beautiful, and probably if I were German and knew the language, I would have enjoyed it more. I won't come back. I don't know why all the feedback is 5-star positive, I presume that the only ones leaving feedback are those who had a good experience. I was there with a girl who #redacted text# told me that she wouldn't leave feedback because she feared Anke might retaliate by leaving her negative feedback as a worker. Honestly, I don't care, I'd rather people knew. I think it would be more honest of the platform to make the feedback anonymous? That way, we could all be freer to honestly describe our experience and protect ourselves from those who only want workers. Workaway should indeed be a platform where work is done but human values and experiences are shared, and this is precisely what was missing.",

Even though some nights have been quite cold , but don't be afraid, you'll get what you need to survive: blankets, hot water bottle, electric heater.After wet weeks of winter, first rays of sunshine were even more delightful. First signs of spring: running & playing foals and donkeys, jumping & fighting sheeps and goats. Funny things to watch.On sunny days I enjoyed working with the horses and of course walking the gigantic cold-bloods, walking the donkeys, walking the dogs... I had to walk a lot, but there are also lots of beautiful paths and lakes around to discover and to walk Beny in the afternoon. Beny, of course, is a dog, there's something about him that you're just forced to love him. Also the sheeps need loads of love. And the two goats too, which are often forgotten.And just besides I learned a lot about handling and care of animals. From Jenny especially about dog training, which was so interesting.I catched a glimpse of how this place is growing and becoming a refuge for people and animals, self-sufficiently supplied with water, electricity and food in the summer.So all in all, an essential thing you need is a heart and sence for animals and no fear of getting your hands dirty. To be a real help it's important to think and act independently. It's practical work which everyone is able to do.A lot of impressions of meaningful work at a peaceful place will remain. See you again soon!Leonie",

They also have a lot of knowledge on how to train and work with animals, you can learn a lot of that, especially if you stay longer. There is not much to do around, but you can enjoy nature: the surroundings are beautiful, there are lakes in walking distance which I got to see in snowy winter weather.I enjoyed the work and was happy I got to work mostly outside and related to the animals.Some examples for the work I was doing: walking the dogs in the forest, cleaning the donkey paddock in the morning, walking the donkeys, painting the kitchen, fixing the sheep barn, building a fence and open stable for the new foals… workdays can sometimes be really relaxed and sometimes long and more stressful, but I always found the work to be rewarding and fun! And I was so happy when the foals arrived and took over the place we prepared for them :)When I think of my time there I especially remember: cuddling the donkeys (Ralf needs a looot of love and Jörg too even though he doesn't like to admit it); the arrival of the new foals (never saw Anke that happy before^^); letting the donkeys run on the meadows in the forest; walking through the village with two super adorable giant coldblood horses; the dogs enjoying the snow (Beny never got tired); trying to drive a wheel loader and struggling to drive a car; catching Antonios & catching sheep; playing cards and not being able to remember the most simple rules (and Jenny always winning!)Thank you so much for the nice time and wish you and all the animals all the best!Fenna",

We did loooots of walks in the beautiful surrounding area, so a lot of the “working hours” were basically filled with nice strolls with Beny or the donkeys. Other things we did were training-walks with Beny and some of the other dogs in the morning, cleaning the area where the sheep, donkeys and goats live, making snacks for the sheep, moving the dung pile, cleaning the house from time to time and of course prepare food for everybody.One thing, I think is important for everybody to know, who wants to join this project, is that you need to be willing to take some responsibility for the animals and for your actions. When I was there, Anke was also working a Job in Berlin and we had the full responsibility for two days a week. Anke has a huge heart and really commits her life to the lovely animals and I have a ton of respect for all the work that she puts in to this place. At the same time she is a strong character and I think it’s quite important to get along with her, if you wanna have a good time there. Also I can recommend to stay there for a little bit longer because it´s really beautiful when the animals start trusting you and with some that just takes a little while.",

The work varied from day to day, but we regularly did work out in the garden with the plants, some diy with wooden palettes also painting and helping to do up his mobile home.

I loved how Dominique gave us the freedom in the kitchen to experiment with food ( which didn’t always go exactly to plan! ) Sometimes the communication was a bit difficult as my French isn’t the best but we managed ( thanks to the help of the wonderful workawayers I met who were also staying there, hello to Vivi, Annachiara, Nils & Vickie 💛 ) For my first workaway experience it was amazing 🌿✨✨ Merci beaucoup Dominique✌️💛",

The house is warm and I was invited to help myself to food if I wanted, although we ate most meals together and shared the vegetarian cooking. There is a lot of varied work to do at Doinique's place and he is also happy for workawayers to do the chores that suit them and their abilities. I helped with some house organisation and a lot of garden landscaping, digging and planting. He is at the start of a project and has a lot of ideas and wants to ultimately have people coming and going and working all the time. I stayed for ten days and then extended my stay. I hope more people will be inspired to come and help him. It is a comfortable place to stay in a very beautiful location where people will feel free to do tasks that they are suited to.",

I felt very welcomed from the very beginning and fell in love instantly with all the animals and the people that I met. Everybody keeps saying that what happens here is wonderful and special, but you really have to see it and live it to believe it. What Heiko and Katja… read moreand Simon are creating here is a sanctuary for all creatures, with two or four legs, big or small, with hooves or feathers, to just live in peace and harmony, without any requirements or restrictions. It’s a living example that no dog or horse or donkey or goat or chicken or cow or buffalo needs to do something to deserve the right to live a happy peaceful life, to get all the attention and care and love that they need. And it’s quite impressive how it all works together, in an ever-changing balance.The daily rhythm and activities are all very much in connection with the needs of the land of the animals, so you can always expect the unexpected. There is a general view of the direction that the project needs to grow towards, but there is no fixed schedule or timetable, so flexibility is key. Everybody just contributes in whatever way they can and feel necessary, and it somehow all functions exactly as it should.For me personally, this place is a ray of hope and I am very grateful that I found this family of many beautiful souls, and even more grateful that I now get to call this place my home for the foreseeable future :)",

Helping with the horses, pushing the hay around and getting to spend more time with the dogs there feels so wonderful. It's a lot of work but super rewarding. Most of what you do is self-motivating, if you see something needs to get done and you can do it, then go ahead, but there are also days where all you may want to do is cuddle with the dogs, and that's fine too, everything is needed, including affection for the animals. I can't wait to come back!Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this project and the people there. 10/10 would recommend.",

So… read morethe rooms, the floors, the bathrooms etc. I also helped with putting up Christmas decorations which was really fun :) We were around six volunteers during my stay. We had a space upstairs all to ourselves at the shelter home.Overall a great experience! I hope to come back some day!",

There're three different shifts every day - morning, afternoon and evening - and each shift is around 5 hours. The tasks are varying depending on the shift but most of the time the volunteers are helping with cleaning the shelter homes and the kitchen as well as sometimes helping serving meals. Apart from that there are always different activities during the day in which help is appreciated and everybody can participate and volunteers being good with tools can always find something to repair, too. The work is never to hard, it's always possible to take breaks, to have chats, to joke around with all the family members and other volunteers - you can feel the nice atmosphere and that everybody is having a good time. Like this working doesn't even feel like that, it feels more like participating in the daily life of a big family.On days off there are plenty of things to do, like discovering the village Cisnadie and the mountains, forests and landscapes in general (try hiking on top of the mount Vagura!), going to the city of Sibiu, which is nearby and really beautiful or even going on little trips (I was able to explore Brasov and Sighisoara). It's safe to hitchhike or to take an Uber, but often you will also find someone giving you a ride to Sibiu as almost every day someone is going and there you can find train and bus stations.The accommodation is super nice, the guest quarters for the volunteers are in a seperate area with bedrooms and living room where you can hang out and relax after the day is over and bond together with people from all over the world. When I was there in times I had my own room, in times we were sharing it with two or three other volunteers. The food is provided and there's always plenty of it, it's cooked daily and mostly with meat, but you can also prepare something yourself (for example if being vegetarian).The best part of this project of course are the people. The environment is very international and like that there are a lot of opportunities to meet people from different cultures and all different parts of the world as well as Romanians and to exchange knowledge, practice languages, and of course having a lot of fun and creating countless great memories. You can also learn a lot about charity work and the situation of the Roma in Romania.I miss all the kids (a lot!) and to play ping pong with them, the volunteers and the place itself and like so many others I'm hoping to come back one day.",

Marion was very patient with me and explained a lot of things to me about the culture, the cuisine, the shwali, in our spare time she showed me around her house , we went for hikking and even the neighbors were adorable with me and invited me to tea and shared their harvest with me so that I could taste their fruits and vegetables. life at home is quite basic, no running water or electricity but we end up getting by. only little advice to give you, bring with you plenty of water because the nearest market is 25 minutes walk away so it is not easy to go there every day! you can also bring coffee, hot chocolate, fruit and other sweets to share with the family, they will be delighted. I loved my experience with Marion and her family, it was a real immersion in Kenyan culture. I am leaving grown up, with new knowledge and very happy to have made this choice of volunteering.",

On Saturday mornings you will have a meeting to evaluate and the week and to organize the following week (decide what work to do and what to study).
